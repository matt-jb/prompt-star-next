# API Endpoint Implementation Plan: GET /api/categories

## 1. Endpoint Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the `GET /api/categories` endpoint. The purpose of this endpoint is to provide a complete list of all available prompt categories to be used for filtering, organizing, and creating new prompts. This is a public-facing, read-only endpoint that does not require authentication.

## 2. Request Details

- **HTTP Method**: `GET`
- **URL Structure**: `/api/categories`
- **Parameters**:
  - **Required**: None
  - **Optional**: None
- **Request Body**: None

## 3. Used Types

- **`CategoryDto`**: This DTO will be used to structure the response for each category item.
  ```typescript
  // from lib/dto.ts
  export type CategoryDto = Pick<Category, "id" | "name">;
  ```

## 4. Response Details

- **Success (200 OK)**: The response will be a JSON array of `CategoryDto` objects.
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": "clxqlb55h000208l3f2r1e1c9",
      "name": "Creative"
    },
    {
      "id": "clxqlc99k000508l3h4j5k6l7",
      "name": "Technical"
    }
  ]
  ```
- **Error (500 Internal Server Error)**: Returned if there is a server-side problem (e.g., database connectivity issue).
  ```json
  {
    "message": "An unexpected error occurred."
  }
  ```

## 5. Data Flow

1. A client application sends a `GET` request to the `/api/categories` endpoint.
2. The Next.js App Router directs the request to the corresponding route handler located at `app/api/categories/route.ts`.
3. The route handler calls the `getAllCategories` method from the `CategoryService`.
4. The `CategoryService`, located at `server/services/category.service.ts`, uses the Prisma client to execute a `findMany` query on the `Category` table in the database.
5. The database returns the list of all categories.
6. The service returns the data to the route handler, which then formats it into a JSON response using `NextResponse.json()`.
7. The server sends the JSON array of categories back to the client with a `200 OK` status code.

## 6. Security Considerations

- **Authentication & Authorization**: This is a public endpoint and does not require any authentication or authorization checks.
- **Data Validation**: No user input is processed, so input validation is not applicable.
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse and potential DoS attacks, rate limiting should be considered at the infrastructure level (e.g., via a gateway or middleware). This is a general best practice for all public endpoints.

## 7. Error Handling

- A `try...catch` block will be implemented within the route handler to manage potential exceptions.
- If the `CategoryService` fails to retrieve data from the database or any other unexpected error occurs, the `catch` block will log the error for internal review and return a standardized `500 Internal Server Error` response to the client.

## 8. Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: The list of categories is not expected to change frequently. Therefore, the response from this endpoint is a prime candidate for caching to reduce database load and improve response times. We will use Next.js's built-in data caching by leveraging the `fetch` API's caching behavior or Route Segment Config options.
- **Database Query**: The underlying Prisma query (`findMany` with no filters) is highly efficient. No performance bottlenecks are anticipated from the database side for the foreseeable future.

## 9. Implementation Steps

1. **Create Service File**:
   - Create a new file: `server/services/category.service.ts`.
2. **Implement Service Logic**:
   - In `category.service.ts`, create a `CategoryService` class.
   - Implement an async method `getAllCategories(): Promise<CategoryDto[]>`.
   - This method will use `prisma.category.findMany()` to fetch all categories, selecting only the `id` and `name` fields.
3. **Create API Route**:
   - Create a new API route file: `app/api/categories/route.ts`.
4. **Implement Route Handler**:
   - In `route.ts`, create an async function `GET(request: Request)`.
   - Instantiate `CategoryService`.
   - Call the `getAllCategories` method inside a `try...catch` block.
   - On success, return the categories using `NextResponse.json()` with a `200` status.
   - On failure, log the error and return a JSON error message with a `500` status.
