# Tech Stack and Justification for Prompt Star

This document outlines the chosen technology stack for the "Prompt Star" project and provides a justification for each choice, aligning with the project's goal of rapid MVP delivery, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

## 1. Core Framework: Next.js with React & TypeScript

-   **Technologies:**
    -   **Next.js (Full-stack framework)**
    -   **React 19**
    -   **TypeScript 5**

-   **Justification:**
    -   **Rapid Development:** Next.js provides a unified framework for both frontend and backend development. This integrated approach simplifies the architecture, speeds up development by eliminating the need to manage separate projects, and streamlines the API creation process.
    -   **High Performance:** React 19's features, combined with Next.js's capabilities for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), will ensure a fast and responsive user experience.
    -   **Code Quality & Maintainability:** TypeScript introduces static typing, which helps catch errors during development rather than in production. This leads to a more robust, predictable, and maintainable codebase, which is crucial for a growing project.

## 2. UI & Styling: Tailwind CSS & Shadcn/ui

-   **Technologies:**
    -   **Tailwind 4**
    -   **Shadcn/ui**

-   **Justification:**
    -   **UI Acceleration:** Shadcn/ui provides a library of pre-built, accessible, and easily customizable React components (e.g., modals, forms, buttons). This allows us to build a polished and consistent user interface quickly, directly addressing the functional requirements in the PRD without building components from scratch.
    -   **Efficient Styling:** Tailwind's utility-first approach enables rapid styling directly within the markup, eliminating the need for separate CSS files and reducing context-switching. This method is highly efficient for prototyping and building custom designs.

## 3. Database and ORM: PostgreSQL & Prisma

-   **Technologies:**
    -   **PostgreSQL**
    -   **Prisma (ORM)**

-   **Justification:**
    -   **Scalability & Reliability:** PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database known for its robustness and ability to handle complex queries and large datasets. It provides a solid foundation that can scale as the application's user base and data grow.
    -   **Developer Experience & Safety:** Prisma offers a modern, type-safe API for database access. It simplifies database operations, reduces boilerplate code, and helps prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection by design. Its integration with TypeScript ensures end-to-end type safety from the database to the frontend.

## 4. Authentication: BetterAuth

-   **Technology:**
    -   **BetterAuth with Prisma adapter**

-   **Justification:**
    -   **Security & Speed:** User authentication is a critical and complex feature. Using a pre-built, self-controlled solution like BetterAuth significantly reduces development time and minimizes security risks. It handles core authentication flows like registration, login, password reset, and session management out-of-the-box, allowing us to focus on the application's primary features.

## 5. Data Fetching: Tanstack Query

-   **Technology:**
    -   **Tanstack Query**

-   **Justification:**
    -   **Efficient Server State Management:** Tanstack Query simplifies the process of fetching, caching, and updating data from the server. It provides powerful features like automatic refetching and caching, which improve UI performance and user experience while reducing the amount of manual state management code needed on the frontend.

## 6. CI/CD & Hosting: GitHub Actions, Docker & DigitalOcean

-   **Technologies:**
    -   **GitHub Actions**
    -   **Docker**
    -   **DigitalOcean**

-   **Justification:**
    -   **Automation:** GitHub Actions enables the creation of automated CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment, ensuring a consistent and reliable release process.
    -   **Consistency & Portability:** Containerizing the application with Docker ensures that it runs consistently across different environments (development, staging, production).
    -   **Scalable Hosting:** DigitalOcean provides a reliable and scalable cloud platform for hosting the containerized application, with predictable costs and the flexibility to grow.

## Summary

This tech stack was chosen for its synergy, modern best practices, and strong focus on developer productivity. It allows for the rapid development of a secure, high-quality MVP while providing a scalable and maintainable foundation for the future growth of Prompt Star.
