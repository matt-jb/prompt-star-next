### Guidelines for React

#### NEXT_JS

- Use App Router and Server Components for improved performance and SEO
- Use server actions for form handling and data mutations from Server Components
- Leverage Next.js Image component with proper sizing for core web vitals optimization
- Implement the Metadata API for dynamic SEO optimization
- Use React Server Components for {{data_fetching_operations}} to reduce client-side JavaScript
- Implement Streaming and Suspense for improved loading states
- Use the new Link component without requiring a child <a> tag
- Leverage parallel routes for complex layouts and parallel data fetching
- Implement intercepting routes for modal patterns and nested UIs

#### TANSTACK_QUERY

- Use TanStack Query (formerly React Query) with appropriate staleTime and gcTime based on data freshness requirements
- Implement the useInfiniteQuery hook for pagination and infinite scrolling
- Use optimistic updates for mutations to make the UI feel more responsive
- Leverage queryClient.setQueryDefaults to establish consistent settings for query categories
- Use suspense mode with <Suspense> boundaries for a more declarative data fetching approach
- Implement retry logic with custom backoff algorithms for transient network issues
- Use the select option to transform and extract specific data from query results
- Implement mutations with onMutate, onError, and onSettled for robust error handling
- Use Query Keys structuring pattern ([entity, params]) for better organization and automatic refetching
- Implement query invalidation strategies to keep data fresh after mutations
